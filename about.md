My name is Ranjan Anantharaman, and I am aspiring scientist and applied
mathematician. I love thinking about interesting problems across various domains
with a special interest in computation. Other than science and tech, I love
discussing topics in philosophy, politics and morality.

I currently work at a startup called [**Julia Computing**](http://juliacomputing.com)
as an **Applications Engineer** and contribute to the [**Julia Language**](http://julialang.org)
and its ecosystem. I've written [`ArrayFire.jl`](https://github.com/JuliaComputing/ArrayFire.jl) 
and [`Gunrock.jl`](https://github.com/JuliaComputing/Gunrock.jl), both libraries
for GPU acceleration, besides contributing to a variety of packages.
