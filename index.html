My name is Ranjan Anantharaman, and I am aspiring scientist and applied
mathematician. I love thinking about interesting problems across various domains
with a special interest in computation. My current interests lie at the intersection of
ecology and computational science, where I apply mathematical thinking to questions in 
conservation science. 

I currently work at a startup called <a href = "http://juliacomputing.com"><b>Julia Computing</b></a>
as an <b>Applications Engineer</b> and contribute to the <a href = "http://julialang.org"><b>Julia Language</b></a>
and its ecosystem. I've written <a href = "https://github.com/JuliaComputing/ArrayFire.jl"><code>ArrayFire.jl</code></a>
and <a href = "https://github.com/JuliaComputing/Gunrock.jl"><code>Gunrock.jl</code></a>
, both libraries for GPU acceleration, besides contributing to a variety of packages.
I blog now and then on my <a href = "/blog/tech/"><b>tech blog</b></a> on topics related to machine learning
and accelerated computing.
<br>
<br>
Other than science and tech, I love discussing topics in philosophy, politics and morality. 
I also love writing fiction. Check out my <a href = "/blog/pers/"><b>personal blog</b></a> for more posts there.
