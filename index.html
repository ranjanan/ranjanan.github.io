I'm <b>Ranjan Anantharaman</b>, an aspiring scientist and applied
mathematician. My current interests lie at the intersection of
ecology and computational science, where I apply mathematical thinking to questions in 
conservation science. 

<br>
<br>
I am currently a PhD student at MIT at the Department of Mathematics. 
Previously, I worked at a startup called <a href = "http://juliacomputing.com"><b>Julia Computing</b></a>
as an <b>Applications Engineer</b> and contribute to the <a href = "http://julialang.org"><b>Julia Language</b></a>
and its ecosystem. 

I blog now and then on my <a href = "/blog/tech/"><b>tech blog</b></a> on topics related to machine learning
and accelerated computing.
<br>
<br>
Other than science and tech, I love discussing topics in philosophy, politics and morality. 
I also love writing fiction. Check out my <a href = "/blog/pers/"><b>personal blog</b></a> for more posts there.

<h1> Projects </h1>

<ul>
    <li><b><a href = "https://github.com/ranjanan/Circuitscape.jl">Circuitscape.jl</a></b>:
        A Julia implementation of the Circuitscape project. Circuitscape borrows ideas 
        from electrical circuit theory to model landscape connectivity.
    <li><b><a href = "https://github.com/ranjanan/AMG.jl">AMG.jl</a></b>: 
        A package that solves sparse linear systems via algebraic multigrid (AMG). 
    <li><b><a href = "https://juliacomputing.com/juliafin.html">Miletus.jl</a></b>: 
        A package that models financial contracts and values them using 
        high-performance valuation routines.
    <li><b><a href = "https://github.com/JuliaComputing/ArrayFire.jl">ArrayFire.jl</a></b>: 
        A package for heterogeneous computing, which allows you to accelerate code
        using a simple array interface. 
</ul>
