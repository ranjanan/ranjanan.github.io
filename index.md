I am a sales engineer at [JuliaHub Inc](https://juliahub.com) for the modeling and simulation product [JuliaSim](https://juliahub.com/products/juliasim/). At JuliaSim, we are building the next generation of simulation workflows using [scientific machine learning](https://sciml.ai/). I work with engineering companies to modernize their simulation workflows, improve time-to-product, and ask what-if questions that weren't possible before. 

I have a PhD in Mathematics & Computational Science from MIT, where I studied surrogate modeling to
accelerate the simulation of high-dimensional dynamical systems at the [JuliaLab](https://julia.mit.edu) at the MIT Computer Science & Artificial Lab (CSAIL). Prior to MIT, I was an applications engineer and data scientist at Julia Computing. I 
graduated from BITS-Hyderabad in 2015 and PSBB-KK Nagar in Chennai in 2011.  

I am a member of numerous open source projects: 

* I am part of the [Julia](https://julialang.org) community since 2015, and chaired [JuliaCon](https//juliacon.org) since 2020. I am also an editor at the open access journal [*JuliaCon Proceedings*](https://proceedings.juliacon.org).
* I am a part of the [Scientific Machine Learning](https://sciml.ai) community since 2020 and have organized [SciMLCon 2022](https://scimlcon.org).
* I also maintain the open source tool [Circuitscape](https://circuitscape.org), a simulation tool that helps conservation scientists propose policy to save endangered species.
