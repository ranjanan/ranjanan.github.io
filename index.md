I am a PhD Candidate at the JuliaLab at MIT where I study surrogate modeling to
accelerate the simulation of large dynamical systems. I am affliated with MIT Mathemtics, MIT 
Computational Science and Engineering (CCSE), and the Computer Science and Artificial
Intelligence Lab (CSAIL).

I also maintain [Circuitscape](https://circuitscape.org), a simulation tool that helps 
conservation scientists propose policy to save endangered species. 

Prior to MIT, I was an applications engineer and data scientist at Julia Computing. I 
graduated from BITS-Hyderabad in 2015 and PSBB-KK Nagar in Chennai in 2011.  

### Publications

[This](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=OxtseY8AAAAJ&hl=en) is my Google Scholar.

### Packages maintained

[Circuitscape.jl](https://github.com/Circuitscape/Circuitscape.jl): 
estimates landscape connectivity across large heterogeneous landscapes. 
Can process grids with hundreds of millions of pixels.

[AlgebraicMultigrid.jl](https://github.com/JuliaLinearAlgebra/AlgebraicMultigrid.jl):
implements algebraic multigrid preconditioners to iteratively solve large linear systems.

[MonteCarloIntegration.jl](https://github.com/ranjanan/MonteCarloIntegration.jl): 
multidimensaional integration using adaptive importance sampling.
