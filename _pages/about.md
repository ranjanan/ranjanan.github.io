I'm **Ranjan Anantharaman**, a PhD student at [MIT Mathematics](https://math.mit.edu), where I work at the [**Julia Lab**](https://julia.mit.edu). My current interests lie at the intersection of ecology and computational science, where I apply mathematical thinking to questions in conservation science. Previously, I worked at a startup called [**Julia Computing**](http://juliacomputing.com/) as an **Applications Engineer**,  where I started contributing to the [**Julia Language**](http://julialang.org/) and its ecosystem.

I graduated in 2015 from [BITS Pilani, Hyderabad Campus](https://bits-pilani.ac.in/hyderabad/) with a Bachelors in Electronics and Communication, and prior to that, went to high school at [PSBB KK Nagar](http://www.psbbschools.ac.in/).
